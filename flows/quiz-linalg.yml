      prompt: |

        Let $m\ge n$ and $\bm A$ be an $m\times n$ matrix. Which of the
        following conditions suffices to guarantee that
        the least squares system $\bm A \bm x\cong \bm b$ has a \emph{unique}
        solution?

      choices:

        - Always
        - When $\operatorname{rank}(\bm A)=m$
        - #CORRECT# When $\operatorname{rank}(\bm A)=n$
        - When $\bm b$ lies in $\operatorname{span}(\bm A)$
