        # Parts of an Incinerator
        Below is a list of the different parts of an incinerator and a functional description of them.

        #Frame
        frame is the skeletion of the incinerator.
        
        #Legs
        Legs are the points of contact between the incineratior and the surface on which the incinerator is placed.

        #Control Panel
        Control panel is the nerve center of the incinerator. The incinerator is controlled from here. Safety devices such as electric breaker and temperature indicator are placed in the 
        control panel.

        #Door
        Door provides access to the burning area as well as the burning coils and the  wire mesh basket. The loading and unloading of the substance to be burnt is through the door.

        #Wiremesh Basket
        The wiremesh basket is the container for placing the waste matter to be incinerated.

        #Ashtray
        The Ashtray collect the ash from the burning process. The ashtray can be removed sideways and emptyied into containers for storing ash.

        #Heating Coils
        There are two heating coils mounted on the LHS and RHS walls of the incinerator. These coils radiate heat towards the wireman basket and the matter in it and cause it to burn.

        #Exhaust pipe
        Exhaust pipe takes the exhaust gases and smoke upto a height prescribed by the WHO so as to avoid pollution.

      # Pre-Operation Procedures
      The following tasks need to be carried out before operating the incinerator.
        1.The  incinerator needs to be preheatd to 200 degree Centigrade before the waste to be incinerated is loaded.
        2.you can preheat the incinerator by pressing the start button.
        3.Read the temperature indicator to note the temperature in the chamber.
        4.Once the chamber has reached the temperature of 200 degrees C switch off by pressing the Power off switch.
       The incinerator will shut off immediately if you open the door without switching the Power off button.
