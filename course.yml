      # Hi there!

      Check out the [linear algebra recap](flow:001-linalg-recap). Do it now. Do it.

      You can also go there using a
      <a href="flow:001-linalg-recap" role="button" class="btn btn-default">Bootstrap button</a>.

      You can also jump directly to the [linear algebra quiz](flow:quiz-linalg).

      Look at the amazing embedded [PDF](media:pdfs/sample.pdf).

      Remember, this image shows the model that CourseFlow is trying to put out
