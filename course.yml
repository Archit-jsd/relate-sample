      # Hi there!

      Check out the [linear algebra recap](flow:001-linalg-recap). Do it now. Do it.

      You can also go there using a
      <a href="flow:001-linalg-recap" role="button" class="btn btn-default">Bootstrap button</a>.

      You can also jump directly to the [linear algebra quiz](flow:quiz-linalg).

      Look at the amazing embedded [PDF](media:pdfs/sample.pdf).

      Remember, this image shows the model that RELATE is trying to put out

        (Note that all of this is sample content. RELATE does not clutter
        your course page with information about itself.)
